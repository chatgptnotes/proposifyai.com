---

## 6. Recommended Configuration

### 6.1 Commission Structure (Bettroi Recommendation)

We recommend starting with a simple, attractive commission model:

**Option A: Flat Rate per Subscription** ⭐ RECOMMENDED FOR LAUNCH
- ₹1,500 per new paid subscription (one-time)
- **Pros:** Simple for affiliates to understand, predictable cost for 4C Secure
- **Example:** 10 conversions = ₹15,000 commission expense

**Option B: Percentage of First Month**
- 30% of first month's subscription revenue
- **Example:** ₹999 plan → ₹300 commission, ₹2,999 plan → ₹900 commission
- **Pros:** Scales with subscription tier, incentivizes premium plan promotion

**Option C: Recurring Commission (Higher Budget)**
- 10% of subscription revenue for first 12 months
- **Example:** ₹999/month plan = ₹100/month for 12 months (₹1,200 total per customer)
- **Pros:** Incentivizes affiliates to refer quality, long-term customers

**Bettroi Recommendation:** Start with **Option A (Flat ₹1,500)** for simplicity and predictability. After 3-6 months of data, optimize based on customer lifetime value (LTV) and conversion rates.

### 6.2 Affiliate Approval Process

**Manual Approval (Recommended):**
1. Affiliates apply via branded signup page
2. Admin reviews application (name, website, marketing channels, audience)
3. Admin approves or rejects with feedback
4. Approved affiliates receive welcome email with:
   - Unique tracking link
   - Marketing resources
   - Commission details
   - Program guidelines

**Approval Criteria:**
- Relevant audience (business, tech, security, document management niche)
- Established online presence (active website, social media, blog)
- No spam or blackhat marketing tactics
- Alignment with 4C Secure brand values
- Professional communication

### 6.3 Tracking Configuration

**Cookie Duration:** 30 days (industry standard)
- Customer who clicks affiliate link and purchases within 30 days = affiliate gets credit
- Longer durations (60-90 days) can be configured if needed

**Attribution Model:** Last-click attribution
- The last affiliate link clicked before purchase receives the commission
- Alternative: First-click attribution (can be configured in Tapfiliate)

---

## 7. Tapfiliate Platform Pricing (Client Responsibility)

Tapfiliate subscription fees are separate from Bettroi's integration cost and will be paid directly by 4C Secure to Tapfiliate.

### 7.1 Recommended Plan: Scale Advantages

**Monthly Subscription:** $149 USD (≈ ₹12,500/month at current exchange rates)
**Annual Subscription:** $1,790 USD (≈ ₹150,000/year, saves ~10%)

**Plan Limits:**
- Unlimited Affiliate Programs
- Unlimited Affiliates
- 100,000 Clicks per month
- 10,000 Conversions per month
- 5 Team Members

**Why Scale Over Launch Plan:**
- Unlimited affiliates (no 50-affiliate cap)
- Higher limits provide growth headroom
- Advanced commission structures (tiered, bonus, category-based)
- Automated payout integration (Trolley)
- Multi-team support (5 admin users)
- Better overage rates ($1 vs $1.50 per 1,000 clicks)

**Overage Fees (if limits exceeded):**
- $1 per 1,000 clicks over 100,000
- $10 per 1,000 conversions over 10,000

### 7.2 First Year Total Cost Summary (Client Investment)

| Item | Cost (INR) | Frequency |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **Bettroi Integration** | ₹150,000 | One-time |
| **Tapfiliate Subscription** (Scale, Annual) | ₹150,000 | Annual |
| **Total First Year** | **₹300,000** | |

**Ongoing Annual Cost (Year 2+):** ₹150,000/year (Tapfiliate subscription only)

**Variable Costs (Commission Payouts):**
Commission costs depend on chosen structure and sales volume.

**Example Scenario:** ₹1,500 per subscription, 50 conversions/month
- Monthly commission expense: ₹75,000
- Annual commission payout: ₹900,000

**Important:** Commission costs should be viewed as customer acquisition cost (CAC), not overhead. A well-run affiliate program typically achieves 5:1 to 10:1 return on investment.

## 16. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Why Tapfiliate instead of building a custom affiliate system?

**A:** Tapfiliate provides enterprise-grade features (fraud detection, reporting, affiliate portal) that would cost ₹500,000+ and 6+ months to build from scratch. Integration is faster, more reliable, and includes ongoing platform updates.

---

### Q2: What if we exceed Tapfiliate's click or conversion limits?

**A:** Tapfiliate charges overage fees (₹80-800 per 1,000 over limit). If you consistently exceed limits, upgrading to the Enterprise plan (unlimited) makes sense. Bettroi will monitor usage and recommend upgrades proactively.

---

### Q3: Can affiliates see our customer data?

**A:** No. Affiliates only see anonymous metrics (clicks, conversions, commissions). They do NOT see customer names, emails, phone numbers, or any personally identifiable information (PII). This is a core privacy feature of the integration.

---

### Q4: How do affiliates receive their commissions?

**A:** Tapfiliate tracks commissions, but actual payouts are managed by 4C Secure admin using the custom billing page Bettroi will build. You can pay via bank transfer, PayPal, Wise, or integrate Trolley for automated payouts (additional fees apply).

---

### Q5: What happens if a customer refunds their subscription?

**A:** Bettroi will implement logic to reverse the commission if a refund occurs within 30 days. The admin dashboard will show reversed commissions, and you can deduct from future payouts or request repayment.

---

### Q6: Can we have different commission rates for different affiliates?

**A:** Yes. Tapfiliate allows custom commission rates per affiliate or per group. You can create tiered structures (e.g., Bronze 10%, Silver 15%, Gold 20%) to reward top performers.

---

### Q7: Will this integration slow down our website?

**A:** No. The Tapfiliate tracking pixel is lightweight (<5 KB) and loads asynchronously. Impact on page load time is negligible (<50ms). Bettroi will optimize implementation for performance.

---

### Q8: What if we want to cancel Tapfiliate after 6 months?

**A:** Tapfiliate is month-to-month (no long-term contract). You can cancel anytime. The integration code Bettroi builds will remain in your platform and can be disabled if needed. No lock-in.

---

### Q9: Can we integrate Tapfiliate with our CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce)?

**A:** Tapfiliate has Zapier integration for most CRMs. However, this is not included in the base integration scope. Bettroi can quote CRM integration as a separate add-on project.

---

### Q10: What happens after the 30-day support period ends?

**A:** You can continue using the integration independently. For ongoing support, enroll in the optional ₹30,000/month retainer. Alternatively, purchase support hours as needed (₹3,500/hour).
