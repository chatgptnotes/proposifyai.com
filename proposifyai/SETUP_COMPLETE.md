## 🎯 Next Steps - Start Using Your Platform!

### 1. Test the Complete Workflow (5 minutes)

**Create Your First Proposal:**
```
1. Go to https://proposifyai.com
2. Log in with your account
3. Create a new proposal
4. Make it public
5. Send it via email to yourself
```

**Test Client Experience:**
```
6. Check your email
7. Click "View Proposal"
8. Accept the proposal
9. Check owner notification email
10. View analytics dashboard
```

### 2. Configure Resend Domain (10 minutes)

While emails are configured, you need to verify your domain in Resend:

**Why:** To ensure high deliverability and avoid spam folders

**Steps:**
```
1. Log in to Resend: https://resend.com/domains
2. Your domain "proposifyai.com" should be listed
3. Add the DNS records to your domain registrar:
   - TXT record: resend._domainkey
   - TXT record: _dmarc
4. Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation
5. Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard
6. Status should show green checkmark
```

**Check DNS Status:**
```
Visit: https://dnschecker.org
Enter: resend._domainkey.proposifyai.com
Verify TXT record appears globally
```
