## 🔧 What Was Wrong

Your deployment had two issues:
1. **Old deployment** was returning 404 errors
2. **Domain aliases** weren't pointing to a working deployment

**Error Seen:**
```
404 - NOT_FOUND
The server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

Status: ✅ HTTP 200 (Working)
Build: Successful
Routes: All compiled correctly
```

### 2. Updated Domain Aliases
Pointed both domains to the new working deployment:
```
✅ proposifyai.com → new deployment (HTTP 200)
✅ www.proposifyai.com → new deployment (HTTP 200)
```

### 3. Verified Working
Tested all URLs:
```
✅ https://proposifyai.com - Returns 200 OK
