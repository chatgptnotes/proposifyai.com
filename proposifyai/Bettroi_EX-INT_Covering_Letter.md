Dear Bettroi BOS Engineering Team,

We are pleased to present our comprehensive proposal for the development of **Bettroi Ex-Integrity (EX-INT)**, an enterprise-grade software platform designed to revolutionize explosion-protected asset integrity management across hazardous areas.

This proposal outlines the complete solution architecture, technical approach, and commercial terms for delivering a world-class platform that addresses critical industry needs for IEC 60079 compliance, ATEX/IECEx certification management, and risk-based inspection optimization.

## Key Highlights

**Total Investment:** USD $135,441.00
**Timeline:** 6 Months | 12 Sprints | 2 Phases
**Deployment:** Cloud-native AWS infrastructure with 99.9% availability

**Value Proposition:**
- 30% reduction in planned inspection hours through intelligent risk-based scheduling
- 98% evidence compliance with automated chain-of-custody tracking
- 95% offline sync success enabling continuous field operations in remote areas
- Enterprise-grade security meeting ISO 27001 and IEC 62443-4-1 standards

**Core Capabilities:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS platform with schema-per-tenant isolation
- Comprehensive asset hierarchy management with Ex marking parser
- Offline-first Android mobile app for ATEX/IECEx certified devices
- Intelligent RBI engine with machine learning (Phase 2)
- Bi-directional CMMS integration (SAP PM, Maximo, Infor EAM)
- Immutable audit trails and evidence vault with content hashing

## Our Approach

The project is structured in two phases:

**Phase 1 (90 days)** delivers the MVP with core asset management, offline mobile inspection capture, basic RBI, reporting, and SAP PM integration—providing immediate operational value and establishing the foundation for advanced features.

**Phase 2 (90-120 days)** adds advanced capabilities including ML-powered RBI, bi-directional CMMS sync, route optimization, mobile enhancements, webhooks, multilingual support, and an external auditor portal.

This phased approach ensures rapid time-to-value while building toward a comprehensive, market-leading solution.

## Why Bettroi

With extensive experience in mission-critical industrial software, robust security practices, and deep understanding of Ex-asset integrity requirements, we are committed to delivering a platform that sets new standards for safety, compliance, and operational excellence in hazardous area management.

## Next Steps

We welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal in detail and address any questions you may have. This quotation is valid for 30 days from the date of issue.
