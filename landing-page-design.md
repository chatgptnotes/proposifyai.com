## FAQ Section

### Headline
**"Questions? We've Got Answers"**

### FAQ Accordion

#### Q: How is this different from PandaDoc or Proposify?
**A:** While traditional tools help format proposals, ProposalAI actually creates the content for you. Our AI researches your prospect, writes personalized sections, optimizes pricing, and predicts deal outcomes. It's like having a proposal writer + researcher + analyst in one.

#### Q: Does it work with my CRM?
**A:** Yes! We integrate with HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, ActiveCampaign, and 15+ other CRMs. Client data auto-populates, and deal updates sync back automatically.

#### Q: How accurate is the AI research?
**A:** Our AI scrapes public data (company websites, LinkedIn, news, industry reports) and cross-references multiple sources. You can always review and edit before sending. Users report 90%+ accuracy.

#### Q: Can I use my own content?
**A:** Absolutely! Upload your existing case studies, service descriptions, and templates. The AI learns your voice and pulls from your approved content library.

#### Q: Is it secure? What about data privacy?
**A:** Enterprise-grade security (SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, HIPAA compliant). All data encrypted at rest and in transit. Your content and client data are never used to train public AI models.

#### Q: What languages does it support?
**A:** Professional plan includes 10+ languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese, Arabic, Dutch). Enterprise gets all 50+ languages.

#### Q: Can I try it before committing?
**A:** Yes! 14-day free trial, no credit card required. Create up to 5 full proposals to test all features.

#### Q: What if I need help getting started?
**A:** Every plan includes onboarding support. Professional+ gets dedicated success manager, template setup, and team training.
