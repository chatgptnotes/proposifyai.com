# 🔧 Deployment Fix - Remove Password Protection

**Issue Found:** The deployment has Vercel password protection enabled, causing 401 errors.

---

## 🚨 Problem

Your proposifyai.com deployment is protected by Vercel authentication, making it inaccessible to the public.

**Current Status:**
```
✅ Domain alias created: proposifyai.com → deployment
✅ WWW alias created: www.proposifyai.com → deployment
❌ Deployment protected with password (401 Unauthorized)
```

---

## ✅ Solution: Disable Deployment Protection

### Method 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended - 2 minutes)

I've opened the settings page for you. Follow these steps:

1. **You should see the Deployment Protection page open in your browser**
   - URL: https://vercel.com/chatgptnotes-6366s-projects/proposifyai/settings/deployment-protection

2. **Find "Vercel Authentication"**
   - It's currently enabled (causing the 401 errors)

3. **Disable Protection**
   - Click on the dropdown or toggle
   - Select "Standard Protection" or "Disabled"
   - NOT "Vercel Authentication" (that's what's blocking access)

4. **Save Changes**
   - Click "Save" button

5. **Verify It Works**
   - Visit https://proposifyai.com
   - Should load without password prompt

### Method 2: Via CLI (Alternative)

Unfortunately, Vercel CLI doesn't support changing deployment protection settings. You must use the dashboard method above.

## 🧪 After Fixing - Test Your Site

Once you've disabled the protection:

```bash
# Test the main domain
curl -I https://proposifyai.com

# Should return HTTP/2 200 (not 401 or 404)

# Test in browser
open https://proposifyai.com

# Should load the login page without password prompt
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened

Vercel has a feature called "Deployment Protection" which adds authentication to your deployments. This is useful for:
- Staging environments
- Preview deployments
- Internal apps

But for a **public production app** like Proposify AI, you need to **disable** this feature.

Environment Vars:    ✅ Configured

```
