# üîß Proposify AI - Manual Setup Guide

**Version:** 2.8.0
**Last Updated:** October 26, 2025

This guide contains the manual steps required to complete the Proposify AI setup after deployment.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: These Steps Are Required

The application is deployed but requires manual configuration to be fully functional:

1. ‚úÖ Database Migrations (Required for all features)
2. ‚úÖ Email Service Setup (Required for sending proposals)
3. ‚úÖ Environment Variables (Required for production)

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Apply Database Migrations (5 minutes)

### Why This Is Required
The new Phase 1 features need additional database tables and functions that must be created manually.

### What Gets Created
- `proposal_views` table (for tracking analytics)
- `proposal_actions` table (for accept/reject history)
- Database functions: `generate_share_id()`, `accept_proposal()`, `reject_proposal()`, `increment_proposal_view_count()`
- Row Level Security policies

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
   ```
   Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xmwnlgnfljufviigrois/sql
   ```

2. **Create New Query**
   - Click "+ New query" button in the SQL Editor

3. **Copy Migration SQL**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/20251026000007_public_proposals.sql`
   - Copy the entire contents (all 199 lines)

4. **Paste and Run**
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" button (‚ö° icon) or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter
   - Wait for "Success" message

5. **Verify Tables Created**
   Run this query to verify:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public'
   AND table_name IN ('proposal_views', 'proposal_actions');
   ```

   Expected result: Should show both tables

6. **Verify Functions Created**
   Run this query:
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name
   FROM information_schema.routines
   WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
   AND routine_name IN ('generate_share_id', 'accept_proposal', 'reject_proposal', 'increment_proposal_view_count');
   ```

   Expected result: Should show all 4 functions

#### Option B: Supabase CLI (Alternative)

If you prefer using the CLI:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/murali/1\ imp\ backups/headz23oct25/proposalai

# Link to Supabase project (requires database password)
supabase link --project-ref xmwnlgnfljufviigrois

# Push migrations
supabase db push

# Verify
supabase db diff
```

### ‚úÖ Verification Checklist
- [ ] No errors when running migration
- [ ] `proposal_views` table exists
- [ ] `proposal_actions` table exists
- [ ] `generate_share_id()` function exists
- [ ] `accept_proposal()` function exists
- [ ] `reject_proposal()` function exists
- [ ] `increment_proposal_view_count()` function exists

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Email Service with Resend (10 minutes)

- Receive acceptance/rejection notifications
- Track email opens

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Create Resend Account

1. **Sign Up**
   ```
   Go to: https://resend.com
   Click "Sign Up" or "Get Started"
   Use your business email
   ```

2. **Verify Email**
   - Check your inbox for verification email
   - Click verification link

#### Step 2: Add Your Domain

1. **Add Domain in Resend**
   ```
   Go to: https://resend.com/domains
   Click "Add Domain"
   Enter: proposifyai.com
   Click "Add"
   ```

2. **Get DNS Records**
   Resend will provide DNS records like:
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: resend._domainkey
   Value: [long string provided by Resend]

   Type: TXT
   Name: _dmarc
   Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@proposifyai.com
   ```

3. **Add DNS Records to Your Domain Registrar**

   6. Set TTL to Automatic
   7. Save
   ```

   **If using GoDaddy:**
   ```
   1. Log in to GoDaddy
   2. My Products ‚Üí DNS
   3. Add ‚Üí TXT
   4. Copy Name and Value from Resend
   5. Save
   ```

   **If using Cloudflare:**
   ```
   1. Log in to Cloudflare
   2. Select your domain
   3. DNS ‚Üí Add record

   Click "Create API Key"
   Name: "Proposify AI Production"
   Permission: "Sending access"
   Click "Create"
   ```

2. **Copy API Key**
   ```
   IMPORTANT: Copy the key immediately!
   It starts with: re_
   Example: re_123abc456def789ghi
   Store it securely - it won't be shown again
   ```

#### Step 4: Add to Vercel Environment Variables

1. **Open Vercel Settings**
   ```
   Go to: https://vercel.com/chatgptnotes-6366s-projects/proposifyai/settings/environment-variables

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Emails Not Sending

**Symptoms:**
- No email received after sending proposal
- Error message when trying to send

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Resend API Key**
   ```
   Verify key in Vercel environment variables
   Key should start with 're_'
   No extra spaces before/after key
   ```

2. **Verify Domain Status**
   ```
   Go to Resend dashboard
   Domain should show green "Verified" status
   If pending, wait for DNS propagation
   ```

3. **Check DNS Records**
   ```
   Use DNS checker: https://dnschecker.org
   Enter: resend._domainkey.proposifyai.com
   Should return TXT record from Resend
   ```

4. **Review Deployment Logs**
   ```bash
   vercel logs proposifyai --prod

   # Look for errors like:
   # - "Invalid API key"
   # - "Domain not verified"
   # - "Failed to send email"
   ```

5. **Test with Resend Dashboard**
   ```
   Go to Resend dashboard
   Try sending a test email
   If this fails, issue is with Resend setup
   If this works, issue is with app configuration
   ```

### Issue: Database Migrations Failed

**Symptoms:**
- Error when trying to accept/reject proposals
- Analytics page shows errors
- "relation does not exist" errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Tables Exist**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM proposal_views LIMIT 1;
   SELECT * FROM proposal_actions LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. **Check Functions Exist**
   ```sql
   SELECT generate_share_id();
   ```

3. **Re-run Migration**
   ```
   Delete any partial tables
   Run migration SQL again
   Verify all tables and functions created
   ```

### Issue: Analytics Not Showing

**Symptoms:**
- Analytics page blank
- No view counts appearing
- Charts not rendering

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Database Schema**
   ```
   Ensure proposal_views table exists
   Ensure RLS policies are set
   ```

2. **Verify Views Being Tracked**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM proposal_views
   WHERE proposal_id = 'your-proposal-id'
   ORDER BY viewed_at DESC;
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console**
   ```
   Open DevTools (F12)
   Look for JavaScript errors
   Check Network tab for failed API calls
   ```

### Issue: Accept/Reject Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Buttons don't respond
- Error message after submitting
- Status not updating

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Database Functions**
   ```sql
   -- Test accept function
   SELECT accept_proposal(
     'test-proposal-id'::uuid,
     'Test Name',
     'test@email.com'
   );
   ```

2. **Check Proposal Is Public**
   ```sql
   SELECT is_public, status
   FROM proposals
   WHERE share_id = 'your-share-id';
   ```

3. **Review API Logs**
