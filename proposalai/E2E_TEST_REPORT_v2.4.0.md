## 14. Performance Analysis

### ✅ Good Performance Practices

| Practice | Implementation | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Code Splitting | Next.js automatic | ✅ PASS |
| Image Optimization | Base64 for logos | ⚠️ Could improve with next/image |
| Lazy Loading | Dynamic imports | ✅ PASS (html2pdf) |
| Client-Side Navigation | Next.js Link | ✅ PASS |
